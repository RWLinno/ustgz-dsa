### Presentation & QA(30%+10%=40%)

- Present 1-2 papers
- be assigned papers to ask good questions
- Starts in Week 2，每周3篇，每篇15minpre+5minQA

To cover 2 assigned papers
May use other materials to supplement the materials

- Max: 20 mins (learn to say what you to say concisely in 15 mins, followed by 5-min QA)Presentation should cover;
-Objectives of paper (including clear statement of problem solved)
Literature reviews (cover what has been done, limitations and gaps)
- The basis of design in the target paper
=Key summary of innovation and solution (must clearly highlight innovation)
Results and how the authors validate the solutions
-The future trends
.Important notes: Must clearly explain innovation and why in design/implementation

### Project (60%)

- Topic: an open project on a MobiDL topic / An Open Project on Deep Learning for Human Mobility Analytics
- Design Report(10%)
- System Report + Demo + Presentation(50%)

aim: to produce a publishable paper & prototype by end of course

DDLs:

- form team:9.23 - sending the team members(1-2) to email
- decide team:10.14 - submit 1-page plan for project
- design paper:10.28
    - to write the outline of paper without results:
        - To cover: objective (why this topic); review (what has been done and what new problems to solve); analysis of problem; proposed solutions (what are the innovative aspects, and why it works); possible limitation.
        - Not more than & pages in ACM 2-column format
    - Grading consideration:
        - Cover all above points clearly with good justifications
        - Well written, clear and easy to read
- Meeting 2: Finalize designs & applications: 11.11
- final paper+codes(30%): 12.9
    - To extend design paper into a publishable paper
        - To refine what has been written
        - To include more details of systems design, implementation issues and key innovative functions of the final system
        - To include results ,ablation studies, insights and analysis.
        - Not more than 8 pages in ACM 2-column format
        - Grading criteria: whether it is ready for publication
- System and Demo:12.9
    - Final Presentation and Demo - general
        - Cover key essence of work
        - PPT presentation to cover the usual what (what problems), why (literature review part); how (your design and innovation), and why (innovations and justifications); plus results and analysis
        - Demo: show the key innovative parts of work; to highlight main features of system\
    - Presentation and Demo to class
        - To present within 15 mins
        - Peer voting of top 5 works
    - Final Presentation and Demo to me
        - To present within 20 mins (ppt presentation < 10 mins, demo < 5 mins)
        - QA
